# Vision  
**Create dashboard of U.S. Map**  
- HTML maps
- States colored by d3 min/max valued by "cases" (choropleth)  
- U.S. map has drop-down select by day with filtered data shown  
- U.S. map has hover-on state show data of selected day
- On-click each state will take you to specified state by county   
- Counties colored by d3 min/max valued by "cases" (choropleth)  
- Each state by county map has drop-down select by day with filtered data shown  
- Each state has hover-on county show data of selected day
- Each state by county map has back-button to U.S. map  
    - **note:** California is active for example of drop-down filter and hover

**To-do list**  
- States and counties colored by d3 min/max valued by "cases" (choropleth)
    - color by d3 min/max should be dynamic. In the main.js code.  
**note:** *there are 2 main.js files - main.js for U.S. map and one for the counties*
- Get data (live feed would be perfered, however, found csv. [here](https://github.com/datasets/covid-19) and [here](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data))
    - **note** current data is in counties js folder. only set up for California at this time. Have csv for all U.S. Counties to upload after color by d3 is completed. 
- ~~On-click for each state~~  
    - ~~Each state index will be named by their abbriated names~~
