# Vision  
**Create dashboard of U.S. Map**  
- HTML maps
- States colored by d3 min/max valued by "cases" (choropleth)  
- U.S. map has drop-down select by day with filtered data shown   
- On-click each state will take you to specified state by county (California is active for example)  
- Counties colored by d3 min/max valued by "cases" (choropleth)  
- Each state by county map has drop-down select by day with filtered data shown  
- Each state by county map has back-button to U.S. map  

**To-do list**  
- States colored by d3 min/max valued by "cases" (choropleth)  
- Get data (live feed would be perfered, however, found csv. [here](https://github.com/datasets/covid-19))  
- On-click for every state (on-click is href in index.html (see ca path as example))  
- color by d3 min/max should be dynamic. In the main.js code.  
**note:** *there are 2 main.js files - main.js for U.S. map and one for the counties*  
- Each state index will be named by their abbriated names  
**example:** ca_index.html (can copy ca_index.html for each state. Will need to replace svg code)
