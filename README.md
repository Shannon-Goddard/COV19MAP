## Data  
- data is being taken as csv format from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv *data is updated daily*

## To-do list  
### Drop-down box
- Drop-down box for user to select by date *currently showing totals for all dates combined*  
Would like for drop down box to be created by for-loop. **NOT HARD CODED**  
That way the drop down menu will automatically add new dates as they are updated.
